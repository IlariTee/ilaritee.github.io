<h5>Welcome! Iâ€™m Ilari Tikkakoski, a logistic worker with a diverse professional background. I have over five years
    of experience in sales with products ranging from kitchens and logistic services to roof renovations. After spending
    more
    than 20 years immersing myself in all things technology, I decided to make my passion into my profession which led
    me into pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology, continuing my
    learning journey at the young age of 29.

    I have a genuine curiosity on learning new things and enjoy trying out new hobbies and
    activities. I thrive on a good conversation and meeting new people whether at work, while playing games or during
    workouts. <br>Please feel free to be in touch!
